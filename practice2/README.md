# ðŸš€ Tech Challenge 6: Selenium WebDriver Practice on "The Internet"
Problem Statement:

In this tech challenge, you will practice Selenium WebDriver automation by interacting with elements and scenarios on the website "The Internet." This website offers a variety of web elements and functionalities, making it an ideal platform for testing your Selenium skills.

Instructions:

# 1. Selenium WebDriver Setup:
    - Set up a Java project for Selenium WebDriver automation.
    - Configure Selenium WebDriver to work with your chosen web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

# 2. Test Scenarios:
    - Write Selenium WebDriver scripts to automate the following test scenarios on "The Internet" website:

# Scenario 1: Login
    - Open the website's login page (URL: https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login).
    - Fill in the login form with valid credentials (use any valid username and password).
    - Click the "Login" button.
    - Verify that the login is successful by checking for the presence of a success message or navigating to a successful login page.

# Scenario 2: Checkboxes
    - Open the checkboxes page (URL: https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/checkboxes).
    - Automate the process of checking and unchecking checkboxes.
    - Verify that the checkboxes change state correctly.

# Scenario 3: Drag and Drop
    - Open the drag and drop page (URL: https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/drag_and_drop).
    - Automate dragging and dropping elements between containers.
    - Verify that the elements are correctly moved to the target container.

# Scenario 4: File Upload
    - Open the file upload page (URL: https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/upload).
    - Implement the file upload functionality by selecting and uploading a file from your local machine.
    - Verify that the file upload is successful.

# 3. Assertions and Reporting:
    - Use assertions to verify the expected outcomes of each test scenario.
    - Implement a basic reporting mechanism to log test results (e.g., using a logging library like Log4j).

# Note:
    - "The Internet" website is designed for practicing Selenium automation. You can explore other pages on the website for additional practice scenarios.
